**Important things I learnt from this project**

1. DOM manipulation
2. Functions in javascript
3. Callback functions

Initially the game was to be played on a browser but later A UI was developed using HTML and CSS. The javascript code had to be changed in order to fit the UI. The DOM was used for this purpose.

This project was completed with the help of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)
